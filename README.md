Simple Python Code Summarizer -------

A beginner-friendly Python tool that reads any Python (.py) file and generates a plain English summary of its structure, workflow, and main code elements.
Features
Summarizes any Python file: Just provide the path to any .py file.

Easy to use: Command-line tool, no dependencies.

Human-readable output: Describes classes, functions, comments, imports, and the script’s overall workflow in simple English.

Beginner friendly: All code and instructions are easy to follow and extend.

How It Works
The summarizer:

Reads a Python file.

Looks for and lists:

Imported modules

Classes and class names

Functions and function names

Main code comments

Generates a plain English summary paragraph about what the script does.

Usage
Clone or download this repository.

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).

Open your terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the project folder.

Run the summarizer on any .py file, using:

bash
python summarizer.py your_script.py
Where your_script.py is the filename of the Python code you want to summarize.

Example
Suppose you run:

bash
python summarizer.py test_script.py
Example output:

text
Summary of the script:

This script imports math. It defines 1 class: Calculator. There are 2 functions defined, such as add, square_root. Comments in the code mention: Math utility functions for demo Returns square root. When run, the script executes the defined functions and classes in order, producing output or performing tasks as coded.

(Optional) Test .py scripts for practice.

How to Extend
Want to improve the summarizer? Here are some ideas:

Summarize docstrings for richer function/class descriptions.

Detect and summarize code under if __name__ == "__main__":.

Add output to a file instead of only printing.

Build a simple web app/UI for uploads and summaries.

Improve natural language summaries with AI or NLP tools.


Happy coding!
